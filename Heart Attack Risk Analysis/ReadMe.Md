https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/heart-attack-risk-analysis


The aim of this competition is to train a model to predict whether or not a patient is at high risk or low risk of a heart attack.


This dataset provides a comprehensive array of features relevant to heart health and lifestyle choices,
encompassing patient-specific details such as age, gender, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, heart rate, and indicators like diabetes, 
family history, smoking habits, obesity, and alcohol consumption. Additionally, lifestyle factors like exercise hours, dietary habits, stress levels,
and sedentary hours are included. Medical aspects comprising previous heart problems, medication usage, and triglyceride levels are considered. 
Socioeconomic aspects such as income and geographical attributes like country, continent, and hemisphere are incorporated.

Evaluation
Submissions will be scored by Accuracy
Accuracy is the number of predictions (that your model made) that match the true labels of the data. Consider a dataset with two possible "classes",
0 and 1. Given the dataset and the model predictions below, we say that the model's accuracy is 4/5 = 0.8, since it labelled 4 data points correctly.
